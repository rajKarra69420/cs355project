## Problem 

Alice and Bob are two subcontractors for the same company. They both have a 4gb file of all the company's client's passwords to be used for app developement. Alice and Bob want to ensure that their files are identical to ensure that the apps are consistent but they do not trust each other. Implement a protocol which allows Alice and Bob to check if their files are equal without either Alice or Bob revealing their file contents to the other.
