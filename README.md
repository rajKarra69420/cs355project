# Problem 

Alice and Bob are two subcontractors for the same company. They both have a 4gb file of all the company's client's passwords to be used for app developement. Alice and Bob want to ensure that their files are identical to ensure that the apps are consistent but they do not trust each other. Implement a protocol which allows Alice and Bob to check if their files are equal without either Alice or Bob revealing their file contents to the other. 

## Project Info

- You may assume that Alice and Bob might only launch passive attacks i.e. will follow whatever protocol they are given, but might locally try to extract information from their view. *But the adversary might attack messages on the network*
- Alice and Bob do not initally share a key

## Deliverables
- code + spec
- security analysis
  - You should specify your security goals and show that they are achieved
- attacks or endorsements
  - You may attack theory or implementation
- in class presentation: short description + demo + attack (if applicable)

## Deadlines (11:59 pm day of)
- Code and spec final commit: Tuesday, Dec 1, 2021
- Attack/endorsements: Monday, Dec 6, 2021
- Presentation: In-class: Tuesday, Dec 7, 2021
